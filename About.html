It currently has 185 schools in 52 cities with over 126,000 students in 458 owned and franchised schools. The Zaki's Academy continues to expand its reach to meet the demands for quality education. The knowledge and skills-based curriculum derived from the UK national curriculum guides students from Nursery to Cambridge International Examinations (for the 16 and 18 year age group), qualifying them for the IGCSE, and O and A Level examinations. The uniform implementation of the curriculum gives parents, students, and teachers the advantage of a smooth and efficient transfer from one school to another within the system.<br><br>Graduates from The Zaki's Academy secure positions in top universities worldwide. Our students, according to Cambridge International Examinations annual results analysis, are amongst the highest achievers in their city, their country and, in some cases, in the world. The curriculum encourages a student-centred approach where learners have an active role in their learning process and develop the skills and ability to make a significant contribution to society. Its particular strength lies in the integration of digital media and ICTs in an array of learning programmes. </p>
